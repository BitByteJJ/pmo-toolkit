(3) How frequently do stakeholders want to be involved? (4) Is there a fixed delivery date? (5) What is the organisation's risk appetite?",
        "For each question, score the answer on a 1-5 scale: 1 = strongly suggests a predictive/Waterfall approach; 5 = strongly suggests an adaptive/Agile approach — the aggregate score indicates the best-fit archetype.",
        "Identify the dominant constraint: if the project has a fixed deadline with flexible scope, an Agile approach is likely best; if the scope is fixed and the deadline is flexible, a Waterfall approach may be more appropriate.",
        "Consider the team's experience with the proposed methodology: a team with no Agile experience will struggle to deliver value in the first sprint — factor in the learning curve when selecting the archetype.",
        "Document the answers to the five questions and the resulting archetype recommendation in the project initiation document — this creates an audit trail for the methodology selection decision.",

    tagline: 'Refine estimates through structured expert discussion and anonymous rounds',
    whatItIs: 'An enhanced Delphi estimation process where experts estimate independently, then discuss assumptions in a structured group review. Repeated rounds refine estimates until consensus emerges — reducing bias while encouraging alignment.',
    whenToUse: 'Useful for complex tasks requiring more in-depth iteration than standard Delphi (T12). Reduces bias by maintaining anonymity in early estimates but encourages group dialogue for alignment.',
    steps: [
        "Define the estimation task: Wideband Delphi is an expert-based estimation technique — begin by clearly defining the work package or task to be estimated, including its scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Ambiguous scope is the most common cause of estimation variance.",
        "Select and brief the expert panel: assemble a panel of 3-7 subject matter experts who have direct experience with the type of work being estimated — brief them on the task, the estimation scale (e.g., hours, story points, days), and the Wideband Delphi process.",
        "Round 1 — independent estimation: each expert independently estimates the task without discussion — this prevents anchoring bias where the first estimate influences all subsequent estimates. Collect estimates anonymously.",
        "Reveal and discuss: reveal all estimates simultaneously and facilitate a structured discussion — experts with outlier estimates (high or low) explain their assumptions; the goal is to surface hidden assumptions and risks, not to pressure convergence.",
        "Round 2+ — re-estimate: after the discussion, each expert independently re-estimates — repeat the reveal-and-discuss cycle until the estimates converge to an acceptable range (typically ±10-15% of the median).",
        "Record the final estimate and assumptions: document the agreed estimate, the range (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic), and the key assumptions and risks identified during the discussion — this audit trail is essential for managing scope changes and re-estimating if assumptions change."
      ],
    proTip: 'Document each assumption or rationale so if confusion resurfaces, you can see why certain estimates were made.',
    example: 'For a novel marketing tech integration, a developer, marketer, and compliance lead each estimate time separately. They see outliers, debate them, and repeat until reaching accurate group consensus.',
