    approach: 'Google used a RACI Matrix to define roles across all workstreams. Each major deliverable — rendering engine, extension API, security model, marketing campaign — had a single Accountable owner, clear Responsible parties, and defined Consulted and Informed stakeholders. The matrix was reviewed weekly and updated as the team grew.',

    approach: 'Quality engineers used a Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram to systematically map all potential causes across the 6M categories: Machine, Method, Material, Man, Measurement, and Mother Nature. The team brainstormed causes in each category, then used data collection to test each hypothesis. The diagram revealed that the root cause was a combination of a worn machine component (Machine) and an inconsistent inspection procedure (Method).',

    approach: 'Story teams used large-format mind maps during Braintrust sessions to capture and connect story ideas. A central concept (e.g., "a fish father\'s fear") was placed at the centre, with branches for character arcs, plot points, themes, and visual metaphors. The visual format allowed the whole team to see connections and gaps simultaneously.',

    approach: 'The programme implemented a Document Management System (DMS) with a structured artifact taxonomy: each document was classified by type (decision, design, test evidence, correspondence), project phase, and status (draft, approved, superseded). A naming convention was enforced, and the DMS was integrated with the programme\'s SharePoint environment. A weekly "document health check" reviewed completeness.',
    outcome: 'A subsequent NAO audit rated the programme\'s document management as "exemplary" — the first time this rating had been awarded to a government digital programme. The DMS enabled the programme to pass ISO 15489 (records management) certification, which was a contractual requirement for the programme\'s international partners.',

Six criteria were established through stakeholder consultation: total cost of ownership (25%), technical capability and innovation (20%), implementation risk (20%), safety record and culture (20%), supply chain resilience (10%), and sustainability credentials (5%). Each criterion was scored by a panel of 12 evaluators representing engineering, safety, finance, and procurement. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the ranking to changes in criterion weights.',
    outcome: 'The MCDA produced a clear ranking: Vendor B (score 82) was recommended over Vendor A (79), Vendor C (71), and Vendor D (68). Vendor A had the lowest cost but scored significantly below Vendor B on implementation risk and safety record.

The company had committed to net zero by 2040 and needed to embed sustainability into the programme\'s HR and working practices without compromising the delivery schedule.',
    approach: 'The programme introduced Green HRM across four dimensions. Recruitment: sustainability commitment was added to the project manager role profile, and sustainability credentials were included in the assessment criteria. Performance management: a sustainability scorecard was added to all project manager performance reviews, covering waste reduction, travel carbon, and supply chain sustainability decisions. Working practices: a remote-first policy was implemented for all non-site activities, reducing business travel by an estimated 60%. Recognition: a "Green Project Manager of the Month" award was introduced, with winners featured in the company\'s sustainability report.',
    outcome: 'Business travel carbon per project manager fell by 58% over 18 months. Construction waste diversion from landfill improved from 72% to 91%. Supply chain sustainability scores improved by 34% as project managers began including sustainability criteria in vendor selection decisions. Employee engagement scores for the programme team improved by 12 points, with sustainability cited as a key driver of engagement by 67% of respondents.',
    lessonsLearned: [
      'Green HRM is most effective when sustainability is embedded in existing HR processes rather than added as a separate initiative — adding a sustainability dimension to existing performance reviews is more effective than creating a separate sustainability review.',
      'The recognition programme had a disproportionate impact on behaviour — the social recognition of being a "Green Project Manager of the Month" was a stronger motivator than the financial incentives.',
      'Remote working is the single most impactful Green HRM practice for reducing carbon emissions — the 60% reduction in business travel was the largest contributor to the programme\'s carbon reduction.',

    projectName: 'Integrated Care System Implementation — Storytelling for Change',
    challenge: 'NHS England was implementing Integrated Care Systems — a major structural reform requiring 42 NHS organisations to merge into 7 regional systems. The reform faced significant resistance from clinical and administrative staff who feared job losses, loss of local identity, and disruption to patient care. Traditional change management communications — briefing documents, FAQs, and town hall presentations — were failing to address the emotional dimensions of the resistance.',
    approach: 'The programme\'s communications team developed a storytelling strategy centred on patient impact narratives. Rather than explaining the structural and financial rationale for integration, the communications focused on stories of patients who had experienced the fragmentation of the current system — patients who had to repeat their medical history to every clinician, patients whose care had been delayed by inter-organisational handoffs, patients who had fallen through the gaps between services. Each story was told with the patient\'s permission and featured a specific, named patient rather than a generic composite.',
    outcome: 'Staff resistance scores (measured by quarterly surveys) fell from 67% to 38% over 12 months. The most significant shift was in clinical staff, where resistance fell from 71% to 31%. Post-survey analysis revealed that the patient impact stories were cited as the most influential communication by 58% of respondents who had changed their view. The programme director noted that the stories worked because they connected the abstract structural change to the concrete human impact that clinical staff cared about most.',
    lessonsLearned: [
      'Authentic stories featuring real, named individuals are far more powerful than composite or anonymised narratives — the specificity creates credibility and emotional resonance.',
      'Stories must connect to the audience\'s values, not the communicator\'s values — for clinical staff, patient impact stories worked because patient welfare is their core professional value.',
      'Storytelling is not a substitute for addressing legitimate concerns — the stories were effective because they were accompanied by genuine engagement with staff concerns about job security and working conditions.',
